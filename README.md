# Tailmoji

Tailmoji is a Visual Studio Code extension that brings a fun twist to coding with Tailwind CSS. It replaces the usual Tailwind CSS class names with intuitive emojis, making your coding environment more colorful and engaging.

## Features

- **Emoji Decorations:** Enjoy a unique visual representation of Tailwind CSS classes with emojis.
- **Toggle On/Off:** Easily activate or deactivate emoji decorations to suit your coding style.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Tailmoji** from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
2. **Activate** the extension by using the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and typing `Tailmoji: Toggle Emojis`. This will enable emoji decorations in your code.
3. **Deactivate** the extension at any time by running the same command.

## Usage

Once the extension is activated, your Tailwind CSS class names will be visually represented by emojis. For example, the class `.flex` might show up as ðŸ’ª, while `.bg-red-500` could be ðŸŸ¥.

## Requirements

Tailmoji requires Visual Studio Code 1.x.x and works best with projects using Tailwind CSS.
